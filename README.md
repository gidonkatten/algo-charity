# algo-charity

[Algo Charity](https://gidonkatten.github.io/algo-charity/) is a platform specifically for match funding campaigns. Match funding is a great way to encourage more people to give and for people to give more as all donations received are multiplied! One has the ability to make an even bigger difference!

Blockchain technology guarantees that your contributions are matched to give you the peace of mind that your money matters.
